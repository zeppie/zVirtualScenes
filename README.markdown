This is my working copy of [zVirtualScene](http://code.google.com/p/zvirtualscenes/).

Work in progress

### Broadcast plugin

A plugin which transmits UDP broadcasts on zVirtualScene events. These evevnts can then be shared with [EventGhost](http://www.eventghost.org) using the Broadcast plugin.

### USB-UIRT plugin

The [USB-UIRT](http://www.usbuirt.com/) is a cool device which allows you to send and receive infrared signals via USB.

This plugin will allow you to manage your own infrared devices. 
Infrared devices are able to learn new commands by simply pressing the desired function on a remote.
